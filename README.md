# 🌍 Country–Capital Matching Quiz

A fun React-based quiz game where players match countries with their capitals.  
The game presents a shuffled grid of buttons (countries and capitals). Players select two at a time:

- ✅ Correct match → buttons turn **green**, then disappear.
- ❌ Incorrect match → buttons turn **red**, then reset.
- 🔵 Selected buttons → highlighted in **blue** while waiting for a second choice.
- 🎉 Once all pairs are matched, a **congratulations message** is displayed.
